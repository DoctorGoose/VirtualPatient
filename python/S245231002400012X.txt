Abstract: Host immune responses play a pivotal role in defending against influenza viruses. The activation of various immune components, such as interferon, macrophages, and CD8+ T cells, works to limit viral spread while maintaining lung integrity. Recent mathematical modeling studies have investigated these responses, describing their regulation, efficacy, and movement within the lung. Here, we discuss these studies and their emphasis on identifying nonlinearities and multifaceted roles of different cell phenotypes that could be responsible for spatially heterogeneous infection patterns.
